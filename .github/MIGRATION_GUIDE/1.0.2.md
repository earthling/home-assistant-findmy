# Migrating from < v1.x.x

Since 1.0.X brought breaking changes, here is a small guide that should help you to 
migrate your setup with as little effort as possible.

## 1 - Install using pip

This script is now available on PyPi. You can install it using pip:

`pip3 install home-assistant-findmy`

## 2 - Setup environment variables

> The password environment variable changed from `MQTT_PASSWORD` to `MQTT_CLIENT_PASSWORD` to be more descriptive.

You already needed to set up an environment variable for the password in recent versions.
You can use the same technique to set up the following environment variables:

- `export MQTT_CLIENT_USERNAME=your_username`
- `export MQTT_CLIENT_PASSWORD=$MQTT_PASSWORD`
- `export MQTT_BROKER_IP=your_broker_ip`
- `export MQTT_BROKER_PORT=1883`
- `export FINDMY_FILE_SCAN_INTERVAL=5`

## 3 - Configure known locations

This is the biggest change, but no worries. 
If you have some known locations configured already, you can use the following script to convert them to the new format:

*migration-tool.py*
```python
import json

# ADD YOUR DEFAULT TOLERANCE HERE IF YOU CHANGED IT
DEFAULT_TOLERANCE = 70

# ADD YOUR OLD KNOWN LOCATIONS CONFIG HERE
KNOWN_LOCATIONS = {
    'home': (12.3456789, 12.3456789, DEFAULT_TOLERANCE),
    'work': (12.3456789, 12.3456789, DEFAULT_TOLERANCE),
}

json_ready = {}
for key, value in KNOWN_LOCATIONS.items():
    json_ready[key] = {
        'latitude': value[0],
        'longitude': value[1],
        'tolerance': value[2]
    }
print(json.dumps(json_ready, indent=4))
```

Now just copy the resulting JSON object into a `known-locations.json` file and you are good to go.

`python3 migration-tool.py | pbcopy`

## 4 - Run the script

`findmy -l /path/to/known_locations.json`

If you need the old behavior that synchronizes device data even tough the location did not change, you can use the `-f` flag.
